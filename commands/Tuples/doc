Description:
tuples

Tuples are objects that can store a specific number of other objects in order.
They are immutable, meaning we can't add, remove, or replace objects on the fly.

Tuples are used to store data; behavior cannot be associated with a tuple.
If we require behavior to manipulate a tuple, we hace to pass the tuple into 
function.

Examples:
stock = "FB", 177.46, 178.67, 175.79
or
stock2 = ("FB", 177.46, 178.67, 175.79)

Access to tuple:
stock = "FB", 177.46, 178.67, 175.79
print(stock[2])
or
stock = "FB", 177.46, 178.67, 175.79
symbol, current, hight, low = stock
print(symbol)


Named tuples

from collections import namedtuple

Stock = namedtuple("Stock", ["symbol", "current", "high", "low"])
stock = Stock("FB", 177.46, 178.67, 175.79)
stock.symbol


Dataclasses

from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class DataClassCard:
    name: str
    current: float
    high: float
    low: float
